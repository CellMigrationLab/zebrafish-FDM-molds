### 🖨 Profiles and settings

This repository provides multiple ways to reproduce the validated printing parameters:

- **`printing_settings.md`** → A human-readable summary of all printing settings (layer height, infill, speeds, cooling, supports, etc.). These values can be entered manually into any slicer (e.g., Cura, Simplify3D, etc.).  
- **`zfish-molds-print-settings.ini`** → A PrusaSlicer-specific profile. This format is inherent to PrusaSlicer and may not be directly compatible with other slicers.  
- **`zfish-molds-print-settings.3mf`** → A PrusaSlicer project profile that can be dragged and dropped into PrusaSlicer for one-click setup.

👉 If you are **not using PrusaSlicer**, refer to `printing_settings.md` for the full parameter set.

👉 May require adjustment for other printers/materials.
