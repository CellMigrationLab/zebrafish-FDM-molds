# Design files for zebrafish embryo molds

This directory contains all CAD and related files for the FDM-printed zebrafish embryo orientation molds.  
Different file formats are provided to support a range of use cases, from direct printing to full CAD editing.

## 📂 Subfolders
- **`stl/`** → Ready-to-print mesh files for 3D printing.  
- **`f3d/`** → Editable Fusion 360 project files with parametric history.  
- **`step/`** → Cross-CAD geometry files for SolidWorks, FreeCAD, Onshape, etc.  
- **`drawings/`** → 2D technical drawings with dimensions and component breakdowns.

## 🛠 Choosing the right file
- Use .stl if you just want to slice and print.  
- Use .f3d if you want to make design modifications in Fusion 360.  
- Use .step if you need to work in a different CAD program.  
- Use drawings if you only need dimensions or want to check geometry without CAD software.
