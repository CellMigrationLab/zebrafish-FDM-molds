# Fusion 360 source files (`.f3d`)

This folder contains the editable Fusion 360 project files for the zebrafish embryo molds. These preserve the parametric history, allowing users to modify slot dimensions, mold diameter, or handle design directly in Fusion 360.

## Files
- **`zfish-mold-D13.f3d`** → Mold with 13 mm diameter, designed for 14 mm coverslip plates.  
- **`zfish-mold-D20.f3d`** → Mold with 20 mm diameter, tested with 21 mm coverslip plates.  

## Dimensions (shared by both designs)
- Slot depth: **5.50 mm**  
- Slot narrow width: **0.40 mm**  
- Slot wide width: **0.60 mm**  
- Slot spacing: **1.00 mm**  
- Slot height above base: **2.00 mm**  

## Notes
- Files open in Autodesk Fusion 360 (educational or commercial license).  
- The design is structured into components (stamp:mold; stemlock:base; stem:handle) for easier editing.  
- Use these if you wish to customize geometry (e.g., for different embryo stages or dish sizes).
