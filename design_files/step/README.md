# STEP files (`.step`)

This folder contains STEP versions of the zebrafish embryo mold designs. STEP is a widely supported neutral CAD format and can be imported into software such as SolidWorks, FreeCAD, Onshape, Rhino, or CATIA.

## Files
- **`zfish-mold-stamp/stemlock/stem-D13.step`** → Mold with 13 mm diameter, designed for 14 mm coverslip plates.  
- **`zfish-mold-stamp/stemlock/stem-D20.step`** → Mold with 20 mm diameter, tested with 21 mm coverslip plates.  

## Notes
- STEP files preserve geometry, but do not include the parametric history or design tree from Fusion 360.  
- Best used if you want to view or adapt the model in a non-Fusion CAD environment.  
- For fully editable parametric designs, use the `.f3d` files in the `f3d/` folder.
